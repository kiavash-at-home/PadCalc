# PadCalc 2009
Resistive RF Attenuator pad calculator

I wrote this program for Santa Clara University's ELEN 711/712 Classes at 2009. It is written in C# and can be compiled using Visual Studio 2019, howerver the code should run fine on Linux using Mono.

This program calculates RF resistive attenuator pads in balanced/unbalanced in PI/T configurations
